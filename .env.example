WS_PROTOCOL=ws
WS_HOST=localhost
WS_PORT=8080
API_PROTOCOL=http
API_HOST=localhost
API_PORT=8000 # will not determine on which port the API will launch, only on which port the Unit Test server will look for the API
APP_ENV=development # development | production
# When production, the API will add `/api/{version}` to the path
# where {version} is the version of the API that is automatically detected
# based on the current folder name (dev, v3, v4...).
# When development, no path will be added.
